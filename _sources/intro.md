## Introduction

Welcome to my portfolio for the **Earth System Components** class. This portfolio brings together the answers to key questions and the practical application of concepts through interactive notebooks. The topics covered help build a understanding of how the Earth system works and how different components interact.

The portfolio is organized into several sections:  
- **Earth System Interactions, Questions**: Questions and answers about the interaction from different elements and phenomena in the Earth system 
- **Notebooks**: combines theoretical explanations with practical data analysis using Python notebooks, making it easier to connect theory with real-world applications.

Let’s explore these fascinating concepts and discover how they shape the Earth’s climate and environment.
